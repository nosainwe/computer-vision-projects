# Computer Vision Projects

A collection of computer vision projects demonstrating object detection, anomaly detection, and classification. Each project is self-contained and includes instructions for setup and execution.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [🚘 License Plate Detection](./license-plate-detection/) | Real-time license plate detection using YOLO11n. | YOLO, OpenCV, PyTorch |
| [🚁 Military Assets Detection](./military-assets-detection/) | Detection of military vehicles, soldiers, and artillery in aerial imagery using YOLO11n. | YOLO, OpenCV, PyTorch |
| [🎥 CCTV Anomaly Detection](./cctv-anomaly-detection/) | Unsupervised anomaly detection in surveillance videos using a ConvLSTM autoencoder. | TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV |
| [🔫 CCTV Weapon Detection](./cctv-weapon-classification/) | Binary classification of CCTV frames to detect weapons using transfer learning (MobileNetV2). | TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, scikit-learn |

Each folder contains:
- `README.md` – project overview, setup, and usage.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies.
- `main.py` or `.ipynb` – the main script/notebook to run the project.
